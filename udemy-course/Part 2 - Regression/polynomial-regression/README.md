# Polynomial Regression

> y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x1^2 + b3 * x1^3 + ... + bn * x1^n

Notice that the independent variable is always x1 (unlike the multiple linear regression which uses x1, x2, x3, etc.)

Why is it still called **polynomial LINEAR regression**?

Because we are not talking about x1.
Linear refers to the coefficients, not the x1!

An example of non-linear would be:
y = b0 * x1 / b1
